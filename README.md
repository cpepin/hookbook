# Hookbook üë®‚Äçüç≥
A collection of helpful React hooks!

## Project structure
In the `lib` directory there is a dedicated folder for each hook, with source code and a
README file for documentation.

## Hooks
- useManagedState
- useDebounce
- useMemoization

## Todo
- Set up a development environment
- Actually write more hooks
- Linting
- Tests
- Figure out if I actually like Typescript
- (basically I haven't done anything yet)
